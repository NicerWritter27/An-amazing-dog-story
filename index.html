                A kid was once running away from angry dogs in his neighborhood. Fortunately, he got to his house before getting bitten, but the dogs were still standing by and waiting for him to go out again. So he called his friend on his phone and asked for help in getting to the library to return the books that he had borrowed. His friend suggested sneaking out from his backdoor. But he was spotted a little while after he tip-toed out of the backdoor. He cannot turn back, and the chase seems to start again. A few minutes later, he lost the dogs and got and got to the library and returned the books. He then called his friends to the park. They discussed the dog problem in their neighborhood. His friend said the dogs were so strong that they broke their leash, and their owner was too lazy to cage them. Another friend said they were lost and got here; they were just scared, so they were just trying to protect themselves, and they chased us because they needed food. The third friend said they were robot dogs that wanted to scare us off the neighborhood. Guye said that's too crazy. After their discussion, they agreed to tell one of their parents to call animal control. Later, animal control arrived, and they managed to catch one of the dogs, but the rest escaped, so the dog problem was still ongoing. One night, friend3 sneaked out of his house and spotted one of the dogs, so he secretly followed the dog to prove he was right. The dog eventually reached an alley, and the dog was still unaware that friend3 was following him. The dog placed his paw on the wall, and a hidden door was opened. Friend3 managed to record everything. Tomorrow morning, friend3 called a meeting with his friends at the park, then friend3 showed them the footage. Guye said they should show the footage to the police, but friend3 said the police wouldn't believe them because they would think they edited them. They need to think of a way to get to the bottom of it. As they spoke, a dog was spying on them.<br>To be continued
